### Hi, there 👋

Have interest in software engineering, distributed system and robotics🤖️, now working for Narwal🐳.

I am good at algorithm and data structure, and enjoying solving and optimizing different problems.
I spent many years in programming competitions and ranked 19th in 2014 ACM/ICPC World Finals.
